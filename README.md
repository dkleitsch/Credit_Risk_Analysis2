# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview
Using the Scikit-learn and imbalanced-learn machine learning Python libraries, a credit risk analysis was conducted to determine which of six machine learning algorithms should be used to best predict credit risk.
## Results
### Naive Random Oversampling
-Balanced Accuracy Score: 0.64
-Precision Score (finding high-risk): 0.01
-Recall Score (finding high-risk): 0.69
